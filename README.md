# Introduction to React Workshop

Today we are going to build a simple application to practice two key skills:

    - Rendering things using React
    - Fetching data from an API

To do this we will
    - Make a parent and child component
    - Use the Fetch API in both components
    - In the parent component (App)
        - We will fetch a list of pokemon from this url: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon
    - In the child component (Card)
        - We will fetch an individual pokemon's information using a different url for each pokemon
